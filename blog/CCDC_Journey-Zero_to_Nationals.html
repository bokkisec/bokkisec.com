								<h2>New Beginnings: Making the Team</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
								When I first learned about what kind of opportunities were out there in the field of cybersecurity in 2022, it sounded like something I might want to do for a living. To learn more about it, I joined the Cyber@UCI discord, but was immediately intimidated by the barrier to entry and decided to just focus on my classes. In May 2023, after getting through some of the tougher classes at UCI, I noticed that I had a lot of free time in my hands. This is when I found and got to work on the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, a super beginner-friendly course for someone with absolutely no experience in IT to learn about the field. It is a super high breadth, low depth course which goes over the foundations of cybersecurity and what you will need to learn in order to excel in the field. With a good amount of CS coursework under my belt, I found a couple of the modules way too easy, but really enjoyed learning about the different aspects of the field.
							</p>
							<p>
								The course was a nice passive learning resource (reading + videos), but it was lacking in hands-on practice. This is when I discovered CCDC. During the first CCDC informational meeting I went to, we learned about the competition and what it would take to make the team. I also learned that there is another competition called the Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC). Both competitions sounded super fun, so I really wanted to compete. As someone with no hands-on cybersecurity experience at the time, I wasn’t too confident in making either of the teams and competing. However, the upcoming school year would be my senior year at UCI, and not making the team would mean I would never compete at all.
							</p>
							<p>
								I woke up one day and noticed that there was a CPTC meeting in progress. At this point, I didn’t even know that training had already started a couple weeks before. The CPTC captain said that I would probably be very lost if I were to show up to the ongoing meeting, but I was welcome to join anyways. Since it was a Saturday, there were no busses running, and I had to walk 30 minutes to get to the lab. When I showed up, everyone was hacking away at an “Easy” rated Hack The Box machine. I had no idea what was going on, but I stuck with it and tried to learn as much as I could. After that day, I was hooked onto Hack The Box, and completed all of the Starting Point machines in 2 weeks. From then on, I would show up every week (virtually after summer started) to hack with the group of people interested in competing, which eventually just became 4 unfortunately. Even more unfortunate, we would later find out that the club doesn’t have the funds for us to go compete &#128532;
							</p>
							<p>
								Over the summer, along with CPTC training, I followed a training curriculum developed by our CCDC captain to learn hands-on fundamentals surrounding the competition and the cybersecurity field in general. The curriculum covered all of the basics from setting up VMs, Linux and Windows fundamentals, networking, red teaming, and blue teaming. After in person meetings started again in Fall, I learned that I was one of only very few people who completed the summer curriculum all the way through. This, in conjunction with the countless hours I’ve put in already, made me very confident that I would be part of the CCDC team. Another event that made me even more confident was the side quest that came up.
